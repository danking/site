<h1>The Faltering of Love</h1>

<p>
She and I connect better than I've ever connected with someone else before. We
both love mathematics. We're bleeding-heart liberals and feminists. She's not
turned off by my predilection for Romanticism; in fact, she carries the torch
for the traditionally masculine traits that I, at times, eschew.
</p>

<p>
There's a sort of smoke in the air. Our relationship, it twirls in circles and
tangents, ups and downs. It wraps around our legs and arms as we dance the waltz
of a new love. The tender smell: unique and fresh, like the fragrance of a
luscious fruit picked from a ragged cliff-side.
</p>

<p>
Ephemeral?
</p>

<p>
I thought not.
</p>

<p>
A great distance, at first only physical--easily traversed with bits--is now
also emotional. Grasping at the smoke, which is now quickly dissipating, is
futile. It was never a constant cloud, but a growing and evolving aura that fed
on those things we shared.
</p>

<p>
I weep ... but life flows on.
