<h1>Working at CERN</h1>

<p>
  Between nine thirty and seven or eight o'clock, you'll find me
  at <acronym title="the European Organization for Nuclear
  Research">CERN</acronym> Prevessin where I'm testing new electronics for the
  Muon Endcap Cathode Strip Chambers. The CSCs are part of
  the <acronym title="Compact Muon Solenoid">CMS</acronym> detector
  at <acronym title="the Organization for European Nuclear
  Research">CERN</acronym>.
</p>

<p>
  A Cathode Strip Chamber operates by maintaining an electrical potential
  difference between two orthogonal sets of cathode strips and anode wires. A
  Muon, essentially a heavier (i.e. more massive) electron, ionizes a mixture of
  argon, carbon tetrafluoride, and carbon dioxide. The ionization induces a
  current which the on-detector electrons record and report to the high-level
  CMS control. The induced current integrated over time provides charge which
  should be roughly equal to <it>e</it>, the elementary charge.
</p>

<p>
  If you're really psyched about the physics of Cathode Strip Chambers, you
  might be interested
  in <a href="http://www.inst.bnl.gov/programs/gasnobledet/publications/Mathieson's_Book.pdf">this
  monograph</a> from Brookhaven National Lab which, in great detail, discusses
  the induced charge distribution.
</p>

<p>
  The cross-hatching of the strips and wires produces a vaguely Cartesian
  coordinate grid. Each chamber has seven layers of the gas-wire-strip
  contraption and each muon endcap has four layers of chambers, providing a
  third spatial coordinate.
</p>

<p>
  The momentum, and thus the energy, of a muon can be calculated from its
  trajectory through the detector, as recorded by the cathode strip
  chambers. The calculation is familiar to all students of physics as the
  Lorentz force law:

    $$ \boldsymbol{F} = q ( \boldsymbol{v} \times \boldsymbol{B} ) $$

  Where \(\boldsymbol{B}\) is 4 T, \(q\) is the elementary charge. The only
  hitch is that we're really looking for momentum. Momentum is given by

    $$ p = m v = q B r $$

  which follows when the Lorentz force law is equated with the expression for
  a centripetal force.

    $$ q v B = F = \frac{m v^2}{r} $$
