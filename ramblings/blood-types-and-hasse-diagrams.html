<h1>Blood Types & Hasse Diagrams</h1>

<p>
  Today is Mother's Day and I had the good fortune to spend the afternoon with
  my mother, my father, and my sister. We spoke for a while about donating blood
  and blood types. I should stop now and encourage you, dear reader,
  to <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org/donating-blood">donate
  blood</a>. I've done it a few times, and it feels great. You sit in a chair
  for five minutes and in return you feel great for saving lives! I'm always on
  the look out for easy ways to change the world.
</p>

<p>
  While discussing blood donation, blood types came up. As you, dear reader, are
  probably aware, the O type can give to any other type. The A and B types can
  give to AB types. AB can only give to themselves. This system of
  classification is known as
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system">ABO blood
  group system</a>. In addition, each blood type can be labeled positive or
  negative. Positively labeled blood types cannot give to negatively labeled
  blood type.
</p>

<p>
  I realized that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse_diagrams">Hasse
  diagrams</a> would be a great way to explain the donation relationships
  between blood types. A Hasse diagram visually depicts the relationships of a
  partially ordered set. A partially ordered set is<sup><a href="#fn1"
  id="ref1">1</a></sup> just a set of things and a transitive relationship. A
  relationship such as \(\le\) is called transitive if \(A \le B\) and \(B \le
  C\) implies \(A \le C\). We can check that \(\le\), the less-than-or-equal-to
  operation on numbers, actually is transitive by trying it with some real
  values. Let's set \(A\) to 3, \(B\) to 5, and \(C\) to 15.

    $$ 3 \le 5 $$

  Yep, that's true.

    $$ 5 \le 15 $$

  Also true.

    $$ 3 \le 15 $$

  Definitely true! Suppose we didn't know that \(3 \le 15\) was true. If we knew
  that \(3 \le 5\) and \(5 \le 15\), we could prove that \(3 \le 15\) because we
  knew the previous two inequalities were true and we knew that \(\le\) is
  transitive.
</p>

<p>
  The “can give blood relationship” is also transitive. Consider, for example, a
  person with the O blood type. This person can give blood to someone with the A
  blood type. We could write this as:

    $$ O \ge A $$

  Note that I'm using the symbol \(\ge\) to mean “can give blood”, not to mean
  greater-than-or-equal-to! Likewise, a person with the A blood type can give
  blood to someone with the AB blood type:

    $$ A \ge AB $$

  The person with the O blood type is known as a <em>universal donor</em>
  because they can give blood to anyone. Of course, this includes giving blood
  to people with the AB blood type:

    $$ O \ge AB $$

  The transitivity is very clear when the three inequalities are written on the
  same line as they are here:

    $$ O \ge A ,\; A \ge AB ,\; O \ge AB $$

  We often write the first two inequalities as one inequality with two \(\ge\)'s:

    $$ O \ge A \ge AB $$

  In total, there are four important inequalities which describe the ABO blood
  group system:

$$
O \ge A \\
O \ge B \\
A \ge AB \\
B \ge AB
$$

  Which we can read as:
  <ul>
    <li>O-type people can give blood to A-type people,</li>
    <li>O-type people can give blood to B-type people,</li>
    <li>A-type people can give blood to AB-type people, and</li>
    <li>B-type people can give blood to AB-type people</li>
  </ul>

  These four relationships form a partially ordered set which we can visualize
  with the following Hasse diagram:
</p>

<img src="images/abo.png"
     alt="Hasse diagram of the ABO blood type system" />

<p>
  The top most element of the picture is the O blood type, the <em>universal
  donor</em>. The bottom most element of the picture is the AB blood type, the
  <em>universal receiver</em>. If you follow the lines downwards, you can read
  off the “can give blood to” relationships. If you follow the lines upwards,
  you can read off the “can receive blood from” relationships.
</p>

<p>
  A keen reader would notice that I've completely dropped the positive/negative
  distinction. We should split each blood type into a positive and a negative
  one. The blood-giving relationship requires that negative blood types can give
  blood to positive blood types, but not the other way around. The diagram now
  looks like:
</p>

<img width="50%"
     src="images/abo-rh.png"
     alt="Hasse diagram of the ABO-Rh blood type system" />

<p>
  We can still read the blood-giving relationships off of the diagrams! For
  example, “B- can give blood to B+” and “B+ can give blood to AB+”. We can also
  deduce that “B- can give blood to AB+” by the transitivity of the previous two
  relationships. Indeed, in the Hasse diagram we can follow any number of
  upward edges to find a potential donor.
</p>

<p>
  There's one more cool thing! If we knew nothing about <em>why</em> these blood
  types existed, we could still deduce something about them by placing them in
  this diagram. The ABO blood type Hasse diagram is <em>isomorphic</em> to this
  diagram:
</p>

<img width="50%"
     src="images/power-set.png"
     alt="Hasse diagram of the power set of {1,2,3}" />

<p>
  This is the Hasse diagram of the <em>superset</em> relationships between sets
  of the numbers 1, 2, and 3. In this diagram, {} means the empty set, which is
  to say a set with nothing in it. The notation {1,3} means the set containing
  the numbers 1 and 3. The notation {1} means the set containing only the number
  1. The set {1,3} is a super set of {1} because every member of the later (just
  1) is also a member of the former. Likewise, the set {1,2,3} is a superset of
  the set {1,3}.
</p>

<p>
  The blood type diagram and this superset diagram have the same shape. The AB+
  type corresponds to {1,2,3}. The O+ type corresponds to {1}. The O- type
  corresponds to {}. And so on.
</p>

<p>
  This correspondence and similarity in shape is no coincidence! The
  positive-ness of a blood type means that people with that blood type have a
  special antigen that other blood types do not have. Likewise, the blood types
  A and B each have their own special antigen. The blood type AB has both the A
  antigen <em>and</em> the B antigen. A person cannot receive blood which has
  antigens that he or she does not have. An O- person's body would attack the
  blood from an O+ person because it has the positive antigen.
</p>

<p>
  These sets of numbers correspond to having or not having the antigens. Since
  O+ corresponds to the set {1} we'll say that the number one corresponds to the
  positive antigen. Likewise, B+ corresponds to the set {1,3} so we'll say the
  number three corresponds to the B antigen. Finally, the number two corresponds
  to the A antigen. Of course, the AB+ blood type must correspond to the set
  {1,2,3} because it has all the antigens.
</p>

<p>
  If we only knew there was a “can give blood” relationship, but didn't know
  about antigens, we could use Hasse diagrams to help understand the
  problem. The Hasse diagram <em>suggests</em> that there are three distinct
  elements that control the “can give blood” relationship. We could then perform
  real biological tests to determine if this hypothesis was true.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, mapping observations to a mathematical framework helped direct the
  search for fundamental physical particles! When trying to understand the
  relationships between an ever growing collection of so-called fundamental
  particles, the physicist Murray
  Gell-Mann <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eightfold_way_%28physics%29">realized</a>
  that they corresponding to basic mathematical objects called symmetry
  groups. This realization led to the prediction that a new particle must exist
  with certain properties. A couple years later physicists discovered exactly
  that particle!

  Technically, the relationship must also be <em>reflexive:</em> \(a
  \le a\), and <em>antisymmetric:</em> if \(a \le b\) and \(b \le a\) then \(a =
  b\).
