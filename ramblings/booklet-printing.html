<h1>Booklet Printing</h1>

<p>
  I prefer to stand, walk, or sprawl on the couch when I'm reading papers and
  articles because I spend so much time sitting at a computer. Likely some day I
  will buy an iPad or Kindle, but they're currently both beyond my means and
  lacking in really effective stylus input.<sup><a href="#fn1"
  id="ref1">1</a></sup> Until that day arrives, I print out many
  documents. Usually I double-side, but if the document is particularly long,
  I'll double-side with two pages per side. Unfortunately, booklet printing is
  not standard in the OS X print dialogue, so I end up with an awkward reading
  experience.
</p>

<p>
Today, I discovered <a href="http://thekeptpromise.com/FreeApps/">Create
    Booklet</a> which hooks into the OS X print dialogue to enable booklet-style
    printing of any document. Remember to select the flip on short-edge option
    to ensure proper orientation!
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, it doesn't fix the ugliness of printed websites. The formatting
  comes out terrible and the navigation elements are included, despite their
  functional irrelevance. I avoid this with
  <a href="https://www.readability.com/">Readability</a>. It converts the
  website into a beautiful format, amenable to booklet-style printing. The
  combination of Create Booklet and Readability yields beautiful booklets and
  only a modest burden on the trees!

  It is conceivable that I could use a current-generation iPad with a stylus,
  but I really want something like a Wacom tablet for sketching in the margins
