<h1>Fuck, I'm Depressed</h1>

<p>
Defining happiness in terms of success is folly.
</p>

<p>
Framing your unhappiness as a mistake that you just need to fix doesn't seem
helpful.
</p>

<p>
Be wary of collecting trophies. Acquiring externally defined success leads to
regret.
</p>

<p>
Leaving everything, disappearing; it sounds romantic. Think about it. Realize
I'll never survive.
</p>

<p>
Is life what you thought you were promised?
</p>

<p>
Twenty-one years in; the mental barriers were built with concrete and they've
dried. Tiny mistakes, disappointments, slights, and failures of childhood grow
like a bush: thick, impassible, no apparent root.
</p>

<p>
Did they lie?
</p>

<p>
Atmospheric darkness pressures the psychological twilight into night. The music
commiserates ... does the concert's commotion block the exits? Do the
pyrotechnics burn the remaining shreds to ashes?
</p>

<p>
Did you mishear?
</p>

<p>
Dust off Maslow again. Food? Check. Water? Check. Air? Check. Third World
Problems. Healthy? Check plus. Financial security? Despite loans, I must concede
a check; thanks Wall Street & Silicon Valley. Friendship? Erm. Love? Are there
half checks? Maybe I could use some social skills. Confidence? Hah. Self-esteem?
Hah. Achievement. Not funny anymore. Blech
</p>

<p>
What promise? Fucking nostalgia.
</p>

<p>
Passion? Meh. Nothing seems to matter; I can't bring myself to care. The
insurmountable piles of work and effort necessary. Augh. Aurelius would be
disappointed in passion anyway.
</p>

<p>
Another six months I'll be unknown.
</p>

<p>
Plaguing the world with your sadness is cruel to others. Throw it away. Bottle
it up. Get rid of it. Nobody wants to read shit writing. Stop filling the
internet with dross..
</p>

<p>
Religion? Hah, the masses have many opiates.
</p>

<p>
Modern life seems a bit like watching porn. For little work we can have instant
pleasure. The delta from instant noodles to cheap-place-down-the-street noodles
to real noodles is insignificant. Why work for the best when just OK is within
reach? Maximum pleasure minimum pain? Seems wrong though. Food, toys, partying,
drunkenness doesn't bring happiness. Bacchus is a fool.
</p>

<p>
And yet we'll keep going, won't we buddy? You and I. We hate the train we're on,
but jumping off looks too painful. It's time to restore the facade, put on the
mask, return to life, return to work. Grit your teeth and move on. As long as
there's something to appear busy working on, you're fine. Your meager outputs
will keep those above happy. Money. Status. They'll come piecemeal. Never enough
to upset those on Olympus. Enough to keep you on the train. Our great success is
always a month away. After high school. After college. After the loans are
paid. Which is, to say, never.
</p>

<p>
Mortgage youth to acquire the keys that open the never ending series of
doors. You'll never be happy. That's the human condition. No pile of self-help
books. No religion. No philosophy. This personality has been burned in, positive
thinking is hopeless, cheap lies about afterlife are meaningless, steps to
happiness are steps to nowhere.
