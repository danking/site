<h1>Down and Tired</h1>

<p>
  I am really frustrated.
</p>

<p>
  I am sitting in a caf√© after working for a few hours on a Sunday afternoon.
</p>

<p>
  There's many things on my list of things to do. I remember putting them on
  this list with great excitement. These were all things I really wanted to
  read, or learn, or do, but couldn't because I was busy.
</p>

<p>
  I now, finally, don't have a deadline pressing me to finish something. I am
  free to do what I please.
</p>

<p>
  And what do I want to do?
</p>

<p>
  Nothing.
</p>

<p>
  The thought of working on anything is disgusting. I want to sleep. I want to
  get away.
</p>

<p>
  Just as these thoughts coalesce I become frustrated with myself. I want to do
  all of these things, I don't want to while away my free time on pointless
  things.
</p>

<p>
  Instead of reading or doing any of my once-desired things, I surf the web,
  doing things I don't care about at all, absorbing nothing.
</p>

<p>
  Ugh.
</p>

<p>
  I just have no idea how to deal with this feeling.
</p>

<p>
  My list includes things that aren't superfluous either. Things like groceries,
  laundry, and school work that I really need to do.
