<h1>Depressed Again</h1>

<p>
I seem to have recurring feelings of sadness. It might be tied to my
semi&ndash;voluntary solitude. I describe myself, with some general
reservations about labels, as an introvert.
</p>

<p>
I experience periods, usually lasting a few months, during which I feel a
malaise. Throughout this essay, I'll use the word "ordinarily" to mean "at times
other than these periods of malaise"; however, the frequency and duration of
these malaise&ndash;periods makes them seem as if <emph>they</emph> are in fact
ordinary and times of happiness are extraordinary.
</p>

<p>
Ordinarily, I enjoy solitude. In solitude, I am: most productive, most at ease,
most clear of mind: most <emph>conscious</emph>.
</p>

<p>
However, for multiple&ndash;month&ndash;long stretches, malaise permeates my
life. When I eat, while I lie in bed awaiting sleep, when I work, and when I try
to relax, a latent sense of dissatisfaction with my lot in life is present.
</p>

<p>
This feeling compels me to incessantly check social media, my email, and news
sites. It seems that I am either distracting myself from this unsettling feeling
or desperately seeking social contact. Perhaps, I am doing both.
</p>

<p>
My reactions to feelings of malaise disrupt my life. I find it difficult to
focus on work, personal projects, and even relaxation. I cannot sit through a
whole movie, watch a TV show, or read a book; I am too distracted by this
dissatisfaction. At work and while working on my personal projects, I am
frustrated by this feeling and must exert more effort than usual simply to stay
on&ndash;task.
</p>

<p>
I am not certain that my social isolation is to blame, but I cannot hide the
reality of it. I have co&ndash;workers with whom I am friendly. We eat lunch
together nearly every day and occasionally eat dinner together. Most nights, I
return home and attempt to work on personal projects, work on my undergraduate
thesis, or relax by reading a book. I rarely have sufficient fortitude to
surmount my malaise and do these things. I spend most weekends the same way:
locked in a struggle with my dissatisfaction, desperately trying to be
productive.
</p>

<p>
I do not have any confidants on the continent in which I live, but I have a
couple confidants in Boston. I occasionally converse with them, but I feel
disconnected from them, out of touch. I am not convinced that distance is the
primary problem.
</p>

<p>
I believe that I, in general, have trouble maintaining friendships. I also have
trouble creating friendships. I understand that I am unusual and thus difficult
to befriend. I seek out mellow, introverted people: talking with particularly
outgoing people is stressful for me. I can temporarily or infrequently cope with
them, but I generally avoid such personalities. Unfortunately, I also avoid
social groups comprising extroverted personalities; the stress of even one can
overwhelm the satisfaction of other friendships.
