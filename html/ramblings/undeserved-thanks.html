<h1>Undeserved Thanks</h1>

I recently had finished some programming work for a non-profit which aims to
teach young kids how to program. They thanked me, but I couldn't help but feel
awkward about accepting thanks. My response is below.

<hr />

<blockquote>
  Thanks again for this!
</blockquote>

<p>
  It's really the least I can do. I was lucky to have parents who moved early
  and consistently to ensure their son loved science and technology; and this
  all happened despite (and largely in response to) their personal lack of
  education.
</p>

<p>
  Not everyone is so lucky. I see programming as, currently, the most effective
  ticket to economic security and I feel obligated to do whatever I can to give
  others the opportunities my parents gave me.

<p>
  Those of us served well by the system really ought to do whatever we can to
  sustain and improve it.
